  ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

      *  I'm VinnÃ­cius Cedraz Ribeiro and in this readme you'll find some information about me.

  ## Relevant Information

      *  I'm currently working on a web browser game I created on scratch.mi.edu called "Parking Aliens" 
      *  It was translated to Javascript using leopard.js
      *  Some errors ocurred during the automatic translation
      *  I'm currently learning some more javascript/html/css to fix them
      *  I'm looking for help with it
      *  You'll be able to find the details in the Parking Alens's readme

  ## Random Information

      *  Other than learning web-development I've been teaching English here and there
      *  I enjoy songwriting, singing, playing the electric and acoustic guitars, 
      *  playing the good old mmrpg ragnarok online, skateboarding and several different physical activities 
      *  Oh, and watching movies and series too of course
      *  Currently my favourite one is Peaky Blinders

 ## Totally Irrelavant Stuff

      *  Fun fact: I only started learning Bash very recently
      *  So at the time I created the vinni.sh e-mail I had no idea what .sh meant in Bash
      *  Therefore, .sh was not a reference to that .sh thingy 
      *  It was just a (fun maybe?) coincidence
      *  Now, what the .sh actually stood for is a story I reserve only for more informal conversations.
